If there are no active Avatar Descriptors found in the scene, the installer will be added to the base scene.

</details>

</details>

<details> 

  <summary> <strong> Activate License </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Auto-Arrange will be disabled if a custom follow target is required but not set yet.

</details>

  <summary> <strong> Password Creator Integration Settings </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/HoloBadge/raw/main/Documentation/Images/HB%20PWC%20Settings.png)

This module is only available if **Password Creator Integration is enabled** from **Advanced Options**.

It is recommended to install Password Creator *after* HoloBadge, as you will need to enable `Badge Compatibility`. This is usually automatically detected by Password Creator if you install HoloBadge first.

You may also want to rotate HoloBadge 180 degrees so that it faces you when locked.

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Banner Event </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Select a Password Creator event that you would like this banner to be triggered by. It is recommended to think through how you will be using Password Creator with your Avatar before setting these events.

`Before Password` will trigger the banner whenever the password has not yet been entered. This is most commonly used for immediate Avatar locks, or often together with **Only when PWC menu open**.

`After Password` will trigger the banner after the password has been successfully entered. It is recommended to leave **Only when PWC menu open** enabled for this event.

During/After Trial refer to PWC's pre-timer functionality which doesn't lock an Avatar until a certain amount of time has passed. This is ideal for public demo avatars where you want to lock specific functionality or lock out the whole avatar after a certain time period, in which the user will have to reset the avatar to continue using it, or obtain a password from your Discord Server.

`During Trial` will trigger while the Avatar is unlocked before the password is entered. It is recommend to leave **Only when PWC menu open** enabled for this event.

`After Trial` is after the trial expires and the Avatar is locked again but before the password is entered.

Please be sure to enable `Pre-Timer` in Password Creator when using a Trial event.

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Examples of using Password Creator Integration </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Using PWC to totally lock down an Avatar's movement until a password is entered. *Before Password*

Using PWC to lock certain animation layers until a password is entered. *Before Password Only when PWC menu open*

Using PWC to lock certain submenus until a password is entered. *Before Password Only when PWC menu open*

Using PWC to lock any of the above after a certain period of time. Great for demo avatars of paid models. *During Trial Only when PWC menu open* or *After Trial*

Distributing passwords via your Discord Server/Patreon/Supporters/Friends/Subscriptions.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Only when PWC menu open </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Select whether this banner should trigger any time this event is active (such as if the Avatar is locked by default) or if the banner should only open when the password menu is opened in the Expressions Menu during this event.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Remove Badge Menu/Parameters </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this if you are using HoloBadge exclusively for Password Creator functionality and do not need to control it from your Expressions Menu.

Enabling this disables **Include Constraint Controls**.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Sync PWC Banners/Parameters </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this to have the banners triggered by Password Creator be visible to other players.

Triggers if your Avatar Descriptor has two FX Playable Layers. Pressing Fix will restore the Action Playable Layer for you, but you will need to re-populate any custom layers you had previously set here.

######

This is a [known VRCSDK bug](https://notes.sleightly.dev/My-VRC-Avatar-Descriptor-is-not-showing-the-Playable-Layers-properly-Double-FX-Bug-e6a68eca97644ec3896d3bda410cd97e) that occurs when switching the avatar in the root animator or switching the FBX of that avatar between Generic and Humanoid rigs when it already has an Avatar Descriptor in the scene.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is HoloBadge compatible with VRChat Quest Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**No**, as [VRChat Quest Avatars](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/quest-content-limitations) do not support Constraints at this time.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is HoloBadge compatible with Optimized Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**It can be!** See the performance stats at the top of this documentation. Your optimized Avatar will need to fit within the remaining stats, but HoloBadge does leave room for an avatar to still be rated as [Good](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/avatar-performance-ranking-system#pc-limits).

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I export HoloBadge with my commercial package? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Assuming you have a **commercial license** for HoloBadge, the script generates everything from scratch, making it easy to export without worrying about conflicting with other packages.

You can find these generated resources at `Save File Path/GeneratedHBResources/`. By default, this is `Assets/JustSleightly/HoloBadge/GeneratedHBResources/`.

The folder with your avatar's HoloBadge under Generated Resources is the only one you need to export. The only exception to this is if you did not have an FX controller, Gesture controller, Expression Parameters, or Expressions Menu by default, in which those will be generated in your `Assets/` folder.

**You may not** export or redistribute the _HoloBadge.dll_ file and other contents under `Packages/JS - HoloBadge/`. Please refer to the full Terms and Conditions on my [store](https://store.sleightly.dev/).

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Can I change the computer my license is registered to? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**Yes**, in the event you change hardware, you can use the **Transfer License** option when trying to verify your license key in Unity on the new hardware. This will require your license key, security question, and security answer. There is a cooldown period to prevent abuse, and these logs will be monitored for misuse. If you need to re-transfer sooner than this transfer period, open a support ticket on [discord](https://discord.sleightly.dev/).
